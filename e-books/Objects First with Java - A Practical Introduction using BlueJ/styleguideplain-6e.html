Naming</strong></p><p>1.1 Use meaningful names.</p><blockquote>  <p>  Use descriptive      names for all identifiers (names of classes, variables and methods). Avoid      ambiguity. Avoid abbreviations. Simple mutator methods should be named      set<em>Something</em>(...). Simple accessor methods should be named get<em>Something</em>(...).      Accessor methods with boolean return values are often called is<em>Something</em>(...),      for example, isEmpty().</p></blockquote> <p>1.2 Class names start with a capital letter.</p> <p>1.3 Class names are singular nouns.</p> <p>1.4 Method and variable names start with lowercase letters.</p><blockquote>  <p>  All three -      class, method and variable names - use capital letters in the middle to      increase readability of compound identifiers, e.g. numberOfItems.</p></blockquote><p>1.5 Constants are written in UPPERCASE.</p><blockquote>  <p>  Constants occasionally      use underscores to indicate compound identifiers: MAXIMUM_SIZE</p></blockquote><p><strong>2. Layout</strong></p>    <p>2.1 One level of indentation is four spaces.  </p>    <p>2.2 All statements within a block are indented one level.</p>    <p>2.3 Braces for classes and methods are alone on one line.</p><blockquote>  <p>  The braces      for class and method blocks are on separate lines and are at the same indentation      level, for example:public intgetAge()<br>    {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>statements</em><br>    }</p></blockquote>    <p>2.4 For all other blocks, braces open at the end of a line.</p><blockquote>  <p>  All other blocks      open with braces at the end of the line that contains the keyword defining      the block. The closing brace is on a separate line, aligned under the keyword      that defines the block. For example:while(condition)      {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>statements</em><br>    }<br>    <br>    if(condition) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>statements</em><br>    }<br>    else {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>statements</em><br>    } </p></blockquote><p>2.5 Always use braces in control structures</p><blockquote>  <p>  Braces are      used in if-statements and loops even if the body is only a single statement.</p></blockquote><p>2.6 Use a space before the opening brace of a control structure's block.</p><p>2.7 Use a space around operators.</p><p>2.8 Use a blank line between methods (and constructors). </p><blockquote>  <p>  Use blank lines      to separate logical blocks of code. This means at least between methods,      but also between logical parts within a method.</p></blockquote><p><strong>3. Documentation</strong></p>    <p>3.1 Every class has a class comment at the top.</p><blockquote>  <p>  The class comment      contains at least<br>  - a general description of the class<br>  - the author's name(s)<br>  - a version numberEvery person      who has contributed to the class has to be named as an author or has to      be otherwise appropriately credited.A version number      can be a simple number, a date, or other formats. The important thing is      that a reader must be able to recognise if two version are not the same,      and be able to determine which one is newer.</p></blockquote>    <p>3.2 Every method has a method comment.</p>    <p>3.3 Comments are Javadoc-readable.</p><blockquote>  <p>  Class and method      comments must be recognised by Javadoc. In other words: they should start      with the comment symbol /**.</p></blockquote>    <p>3.4 Code comments (only) where necessary.</p><blockquote>  <p>  Comments in      the code should be included where the code is not obvious or difficult      to understand (while preference should be given to make the code obvious      or easy to understand where possible), and where it helps understanding      of a method. Do not comment obvious statements - assume your reader understands      Java!<br>  </p></blockquote><p><strong>4. Language use restrictions</strong></p>    <p>4.1 Order of declarations: fields, constructors, methods.</p><blockquote>  <p>  The elements      of a class definition appear (if present) in the following order: package      statement; import statements; class comment; class header; field definitions;constructors; methods.</p></blockquote>    <p>4.2 Fields may not be public (except for final fields).</p>    <p>4.3 Always use an access modifier.</p><blockquote>  <p>  Specify all      fields and methods as either private, public, or protected. Never use default      (package private) access.</p></blockquote>    <p>4.4 Import classes separately.</p><blockquote>  <p>  Import statements      explicitly naming every class are preferred over importing whole packages.      E.g.</p>  <blockquote>    <p>    import java.util.ArrayList;</p>    <p><br>      import java.util.HashSet;</p>  </blockquote>  <p>is better than</p>  <blockquote>    <p>    import java.util.*;</p>  </blockquote></blockquote>    <p>4.5 Always include a constructor (even if the body is empty).</p>    <p>4.6 Always include superclass constructor call.</p><blockquote>  <p>  In constructors      of subclasses, do not rely on automatic insertion of a superclass call.      Include the super(...) call explicitly, even if it would work without it.</p></blockquote>    <p>4.7 Initialise all fields in the constructor.</p>    <p><br><strong>5. Code idioms</strong></p>    <p>5.1 Use iterators with collections.</p><blockquote>  <p>  To iterate      over a collection, use a for-each loop. When the collection must be changedduring iteration use an Iterator, not an integer index.</p></blockquote><hr align="left" width="100" size="1" noshade><p> <strong>Copyright notice</strong> </p><p><em>Copyright        (c) Michael K&ouml;lling and David Barnes.This        style guide was written for the book </em>Objects First With Java - A Practical        Introduction Using BlueJ<em>.
