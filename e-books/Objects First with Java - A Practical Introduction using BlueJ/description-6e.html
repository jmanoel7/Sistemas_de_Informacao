                    book is an introduction to object-oriented programming for 
                    beginners. The main focus of the book is general object-oriented 
                    and programming concepts from a software engineering perspective. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">While 
                    the first chapters are written for students with no programming 
                    experience, later chapters are suitable for more advanced 
                    or professional programmers as well. In particular, programmers 
                    with experience in a non-object-oriented language who wish 
                    to migrate their skills into object orientation should also 
                    be able to benefit from the book. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We use 
                    two tools throughout the book to enable the concepts introduced 
                    to be put into practice: These tools are the Java programming 
                    language and the Java development environment BlueJ. </font></p>

                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Java 
                    was chosen because of a combination of two aspects: the language 
                    design and its popularity. The Java programming language itself 
                    provides a very clean implementation of most of the important 
                    object-oriented concepts, and serves well as an introductory 
                    teaching language. Its popularity ensures an immense pool 
                    of support resources. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In any 
                    subject area, having a variety of sources of information available 
                    is very helpful, for teachers and students alike. For Java 
                    in particular, countless books, tutorials, exercises, compilers, 
                    environments, and quizzes already exist, in many different 
                    kinds and styles. Many of them are online and many are available 
                    free of charge. The large amount and good quality of support 
                    material makes Java an excellent choice as an introduction 
                    to object-oriented programming. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">With 
                    so much Java material already available, is there still room 
                    for more to be said about it? We think there is, and the second 
                    tool we use is one of the reasons ... </font></p>

                    </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The second 
                    tool, BlueJ, deserves more comment. This book is unique in 
                    its completely integrated use of the BlueJ environment. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">BlueJ
                      is a Java development environment that is being developed
                      and maintained at the  University of Kent
                      at Canterbury, UK, and La Trobe University, Melbourne, explicitly as an environment for teaching
                      introductory object-oriented programming. It is better
                      suited to introductory teaching than other environments
                      for a variety of reasons: </font></p>

                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
                      user interface is much simpler. Beginning students can typically 
                      use the BlueJ environment in a competent manner after 20 
                      minutes of introduction. From then on, instruction can concentrate 
                      on the important concepts at hand - object orientation and 
                      Java - and no time needs to be wasted talking about environments, 
                      file systems, class paths, DOS commands or DLL conflicts. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      </font></li>
                    <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
                      environment supports important teaching tools not available 
                      in other environments. One of them is visualization of class 
                      structure. BlueJ automatically displays a UML-like diagram 
                      representing the classes and relationships in a project. 
                      Visualizing these important concepts is a great help to 
                      both teachers and students. It is hard to grasp the concept 
                      of an object when all you ever see on the screen is lines 
                      of code! The diagram notation is a simple subset of UML, 
                      again tailored to the needs of beginning students. This 
                      makes it easy to understand, but also allows migration to 
                      full UML in later courses. <br>

                    <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> One 
                      of the most important strengths of the BlueJ environment 
                      is the user's ability to create directly objects of any 
                      class, and then to interact with their methods. This creates 
                      the opportunity for direct experimentation with objects, 
                      for little overhead in the environment. Students can almost 
                      'feel' what it means to create an object, call a method, 
                      pass a parameter or receive a return value. They can try 
                      out a method immediately after it has been written, without 
                      the need to write test drivers. This facility is an invaluable 
                      aid in understanding the underlying concepts and language 
                      details. </font></li>

                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">BlueJ 
                    is a full Java environment. It is not a cut down, simplified 
                    version of Java for teaching. It runs on top of Sun Microsystems' 
                    Java Development Kit, and makes use of the standard compiler 
                    and virtual machine. This ensures that it always conforms 
                    to the official and most up-to-date Java specification. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The authors 
                    of this book have several years of teaching experience with 
                    the BlueJ environment (and many more years without it before 
                    that). We both have experienced how the use of BlueJ has increased 
                    the involvement, understanding and activity of students in 
                    our courses. One of the authors is also a developer of the 
                    BlueJ system. </font></p>

                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">One of 
                    the reasons for choosing BlueJ was that it allows an approach 
                    where teachers truly deal with the important concepts first. 
                    'Objects early' has been a battle cry for many textbook authors 
                    and teachers for some time. Unfortunately, the Java language 
                    does not make this noble goal very easy. Numerous hurdles 
                    of syntax and detail have to be overcome before the first 
                    experience with a living object arises. The minimal Java program 
                    to create and call an object typically includes:</font></p>

                      a main method, including concepts such as static methods, 
                      parameters, and arrays in the signature;</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> a 
                      statement to create the object ('new'); </font></li>

                      to work their way through this forbidding list, and only

                      objects at all. </font></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">With 
                    BlueJ, this is not a problem. A student can create an object 
                    and call its methods as the very first activity! Because users 
                    can create and interact with objects directly, concepts such 
                    as classes, objects, methods and parameters can easily be 
                    discussed in a concrete manner before looking at the first 
                    line of Java syntax. Instead of explaining more about this 
                    here, we suggest that the curious reader dip into Chapter 
                    1 - things will quickly become clear then. </font></p>
                  <p><b><a name="iterative"></a>An iterative approach</b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Another
                       important aspect of this book is that it follows an iterative
                       style. In the computing education community, a well-known
                       educational design pattern exists that states that important
                       concepts should be taught early and often (The &quot;Early
                        Bird&quot; pattern, in J. Bergin: &quot; <i>Fourteen Pedagogical
                         Patterns for Teaching Computer Science</i>&quot;, Proceedings
                         of  the Fifth European Conference on Pattern Languages
                         of Programs  (EuroPLop 2000), Irsee, Germany, July 2000).
                         It is very tempting  for textbook authors to try and
                         say everything about a topic  at the point where it
                         is introduced. For example, it is common,  when introducing
                         types, to give a full list of built-in data  types,
                         or to discuss all available kinds of loops when introducing
                          the concept of a loop. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">These 
                    two approaches conflict: we cannot concentrate on discussing 
                    important concepts first, and at the same time provide complete 
                    coverage of all topics encountered. Our experience with textbooks 
                    is that much of the detail is initially distracting, and has 
                    the effect of drowning the important points, thus making them 
                    harder to grasp. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In this 
                    book, we touch on all of the important topics several times, 
                    both within the same chapter and across different chapters. 
                    Concepts are usually introduced at a level of detail necessary 
                    for understanding and applying the task at hand. They are 
                    revisited later in a different context, and understanding 
                    deepens as the reader continues through the chapters. This 
                    approach also helps to deal with the frequent occurrence of 
                    mutual dependencies between concepts. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Some 
                    teachers may not be familiar with an iterative approach. Looking 
                    at the first few chapters, teachers used to a more sequential 
                    introduction will be surprised about the number of concepts 
                    touched on this early. It may seem like a steep learning curve. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It is 
                    important to understand that this is not the end of the story. 
                    Students are not expected to understand everything about these 
                    concepts immediately. Instead, these fundamental concepts 
                    will be revisited again and again throughout the book, allowing 
                    students to get a deeper and deeper understanding over time. 
                    Since their knowledge level changes as they work their way 
                    forward, revisiting important topics later allows them to 
                    gain a deeper understanding overall. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We have 
                    tried this approach with students many times. It seems that 
                    students have fewer problems dealing with it than some long 
                    time teachers. And remember: a steep learning curve is not 
                    a problem as long as you ensure that your students can climb 
                    it! </font></p>

                    to our iterative approach is the decision not to try to provide

                       Students studying with this book may be working as software
                       professionals for the next 30 or 40 years of their life
                      - is a fairly safe bet that the majority of their
                       work will not be in Java. Every serious textbook must
                       of course attempt to prepare them for something more fundamental
                       than the language flavor of the day. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">On the 
                    other hand, many Java details are important for actually doing 
                    the practical work. In this book, we cover Java constructs 
                    in as much detail as is necessary to illustrate the concepts 
                    at hand and implement the practical work. Some constructs 
                    specific to Java have been deliberately left out of the discussion. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We are 
                    aware that some instructors will choose to cover some topics 
                    that we do not discuss in detail. That is expected and necessary. 
                    However, instead of trying to cover every possible topic ourselves 
                    (and thus blowing the size of this book out to 1500 pages), 
                    we deal with it using hooks. Hooks are pointers, often in 
                    the form of questions that raise the topic and give references 
                    to an appendix or outside material. These hooks ensure that 
                    a relevant topic is brought up at an appropriate time, and 
                    leaves it up to the reader or the teacher to decide to what 
                    level of detail that topic should be covered. Thus, hooks 
                    serve as a reminder of the existence of the topic and a placeholder 
                    indicating a point in the sequence where discussion can be 
                    inserted. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Individual 
                    teachers can decide to use the book as it is, following our 
                    suggested sequence, or to branch out into sidetracks suggested 
                    by the hooks in the text. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Each 
                    chapter also includes several questions suggesting discussion 
                    material related to the topic, but not discussed in this book. 
                    We fully expect teachers to discuss some of these questions 
                    in class, or students to research the answers as homework 
                    exercises. </font></p>
                  <p><b><a name="project"></a>Project-driven approach</b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The introduction 
                    of material in the book is project driven. The book discusses 
                    numerous programming projects and provides many exercises. 
                    Instead of introducing a new construct and then providing 
                    an exercise to apply this construct to solve a task, we first 
                    provide a goal and a problem. Analyzing the problem at hand 
                    determines what kinds of solutions we need. As a consequence, 
                    language constructs are introduced as they are needed to solve 
                    the problems before us. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Almost 
                    all chapters provide at least two discussion examples. These 
                    are projects that are discussed in detail to illustrate the 
                    important concepts of each chapter. Using two very different 
                    examples supports the iterative approach: each concept is 
                    revisited in a different context after it is introduced. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In designing 
                    this book, we have tried to use a large number and wide variety 
                    of different example projects. This will hopefully serve to 
                    capture the reader's interest, but it also helps to illustrate 
                    the variety of different contexts in which the concepts can 
                    be applied. Finding good example projects is hard. We hope 
                    that our projects serve to give teachers good starting points 
                    and many ideas for a wide variety of interesting assignments. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The implementation 
                    for all our projects is written very carefully, so that many 
                    peripheral issues may be studied by reading the projects' 
                    source code. We are strong believers in the benefit of learning 
                    by reading and imitating good examples. For this to work, 
                    however, one must make sure that the examples students read 
                    are well written and worth imitating. We have tried to do 
                    this. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">All projects 
                    are designed as open-ended problems. While one or more versions 
                    of each problem are discussed in detail in the book, the projects 
                    are designed so that further extensions and improvements can 
                    be done as student projects. Complete source code for all 
                    projects is included. A list of projects discussed in this 
                    book is provided in the book. </font></p>
                  <p><b><a name="concept"></a>Concept sequence rather than language 
                    constructs</b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">One other 
                    aspect that distinguishes this book from many others is that 
                    it is structured along fundamental software development tasks 
                    and not necessarily according to the particular Java language 
                    constructs. One indicator of this is the chapter headings. 
                    In this book, you will not find many of the traditional chapters 
                    titles, such as 'Primitive data types' or 'Control structures'. 
                    Structuring by fundamental development tasks allows us to 
                    give a much more general introduction that is not driven by 
                    intricacies of the particular programming language utilized. 
                    We also believe that it is easier for students to follow the 
                    motivation of the introduction, and that it makes it much 
                    more interesting. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As a 
                    result of this approach, it is less straightforward to use 
                    the book as a reference book. Introductory textbooks and reference 
                    books have different, partly competing, goals. To a certain 
                    extent, a book can try to be both, but compromises have to 
                    be made at certain points. Our book is clearly designed as 
                    a textbook, and wherever a conflict occurred, the textbook 
                    style took precedence over its use as a reference book. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We have, 
                    however, provided support for use as a reference book by listing 
                    the Java constructs introduced in each chapter in the chapter 
                    introduction. </font></p>
